# buffer_overflow_attacks

Using Altera Quartus Prime and the Nios II Software Build Tools in Eclipse, create a buffer overflow using two, 8-digit numbers 
and then prevent the buffer overflow.

An Altera Quartus Prime project must be created and connected to a Nios II Processor using QSYS for this to work.
